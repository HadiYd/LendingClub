## Our Goal

Given historical data on loans can we build a model to predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? For example, in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. 

The "loan_status" column contains our label.


## Outline: <br><br>
I. Introduction <br>
a) Data Overview<br>
b) Starter Code<br>
c) Loading data and other imports<br>

II. Exploratory Data Analysis<br>
a) Exploring correlation between the continuous feature variables <br>
b) Changing the catagorical label of loan_status to numerical one <br>


III. Data Preprocessing<br>
a) Missing data<br>
b) Categorical Variables and Dummy Variables<br>
c) Normalizing the Data<br>

IV. Creating the Model<br>

V. Evaluating Model Performance<br>
